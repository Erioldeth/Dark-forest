## Dark forest
Being lost in the middle of nowhere with no supply, surrounded by hellish creatures with only one target: your soul.
It is said that in that situation, you should give up...
However, why don't you give a try and survive for as long as possible...
Maybe, just maybe, someone will come and save you...
